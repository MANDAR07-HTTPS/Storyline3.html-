            <h3><b><i>The Battle of Pratapgad on November 10, 1659, was a turning point in Shivaji Maharaj's life. Afzal Khan was a general of the Bijapur Sultanate and wanted to get rid of Shivaji by treachery in the garb of peace negotiation. He met Shivaji at the base of Pratapgad Fort. Shivaji had come in full preparation to meet Afzal Khan, knowing his intention. During the meeting, he tried to strangle Shivaji with a weapon concealed in his robes. But Shivaji had taken care to wear in his hand a hidden weapon, "Wagh Nakh" (tiger claws), and thus foiled the attack and sent Afzal Khan to a tragic death. After that Shivaji's men successfully entrapped and defeated the much larger Bijapur army by using guerilla tactics. This victory cemented Shivaji's reputation and expanded his control over the region. </i></b></h3>
